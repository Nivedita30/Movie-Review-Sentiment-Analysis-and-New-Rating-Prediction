# Project 2: Choose Your Own Idea

## Overview

In this project, I utilized the skills learned in class to develop a data science solution for a problem of my choice. The project encouraged creativity and innovation by allowing me to propose my own idea and design a service or solution based on data science technology. The goal was to design a product, service, or solution and prepare a pitch for the idea.

## Problem Statement

I was tasked with identifying a problem I wished to solve using data science techniques. The problem should be significant, interesting, and have the potential to make an impact in a specific area. Furthermore, it should be feasible to solve using available data and data mining/machine learning solutions.

## Proposal

### 1) The problem I tried to solve:

The problem I aimed to address was predicting movie ratings and performing sentiment analysis based on user reviews. By analyzing movie reviews, I sought to generate new ratings that incorporated sentiment analysis, providing a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of movie quality.

### 2) Why the problem is important to solve:

Movie reviews play a crucial role in influencing viewers' decisions about which movies to watch. However, traditional rating systems may not fully capture the sentiment expressed in reviews, leading to discrepancies between numerical ratings and actual viewer opinions. By integrating sentiment analysis into the rating system, we can offer more accurate and informative ratings that align with viewers' expectations.

### 3) My idea to solve the problem:

My proposed solution involved utilizing machine learning algorithms to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews. I trained models to predict sentiment scores for each review and combined these scores with the original ratings to generate new, sentiment-aware ratings. By leveraging techniques such as Random Forest Classifier, Linear SVC, and Multi-layer Perceptron, I aimed to develop a robust rating system that reflected both numerical ratings and sentiment analysis.

### 4) Differences I could make with my data science approach:

- **Sentiment Analysis**: My approach went beyond traditional rating systems by incorporating sentiment analysis, allowing me to capture the underlying sentiment expressed in movie reviews.
- **Enhanced Ratings**: The new ratings generated by my model provided a more comprehensive view of movie quality by considering both numerical ratings and sentiment analysis.
- **Multiple Machine Learning Algorithms**: By utilizing various machine learning algorithms, I could explore different approaches and potentially improve the accuracy and robustness of the sentiment analysis model.
- **Flexibility and Adaptability**: My solution offered a flexible framework that could be extended or modified to accommodate different types of movie review datasets or adapted for use in other domains beyond movie ratings.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

### Data Collection:

I collected movie reviews data from the Rotten Tomatoes database, including both critic reviews and user ratings.

### Data Preprocessing:

- Removed null values and duplicates from the dataset.
- Converted review scores to a standardized numerical scale.
- Preprocessed text data by removing stopwords, stemming, and lemmatizing words to prepare it for sentiment analysis.

## Data Analysis

I conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of review scores and sentiment in the dataset. Additionally, I performed N-gram analysis to identify common word patterns in movie reviews.

## Model Development and Evaluation

I trained three machine learning models (Random Forest Classifier, Linear SVC, and Multi-layer Perceptron) to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews. Each model was evaluated based on accuracy and performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). I also compared the new ratings generated by each model with the original ratings to assess their effectiveness.

## Results

- My sentiment analysis models achieved high accuracy in predicting sentiment scores for movie reviews.
- The new ratings generated by my models showed a strong correlation with the original ratings, indicating the effectiveness of incorporating sentiment analysis into the rating system.
- I observed differences in performance among the different machine learning algorithms, with each model demonstrating unique strengths and characteristics.

## Conclusion

My data science approach offers a novel solution to the challenge of predicting movie ratings and performing sentiment analysis on user reviews. By integrating sentiment analysis into the rating system, I provide viewers with more informative and accurate ratings that better reflect the sentiment expressed in movie reviews. My solution has the potential to enhance the movie-watching experience for viewers and assist them in making more informed decisions about which movies to watch.

## Future Work

- Integration of real-time data to continuously update and improve the sentiment analysis model.
- Exploration of advanced machine learning algorithms and techniques to further enhance the accuracy and performance of the sentiment analysis model.
- Development of a user-friendly interface for accessing and visualizing movie ratings and sentiment analysis results.
